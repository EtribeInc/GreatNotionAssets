# GreatNotionAssets

This is a repo of build artifacts that is hosted by [Netlify](https://great-notion-assets.netlify.app).

The DLC files are Unity Asset Bundle builds that the Flutter test app downloads to local device storage. The production Flutter app will host these files on a production CDN. 

The Flutter files are meant to be integrated into the production Flutter app codebase. The Flutter app team downloads these files here: https://great-notion-assets.netlify.app/flutter
